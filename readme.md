<h1>Hydroponic Monitoring System with ESP32 and Django</h1>
<p>This is a hydroponic monitoring system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller to collect data from sensors and send it via MQTT to a Django server for storage and analysis. The system is designed to help growers monitor and manage their hydroponic setups, providing real-time data on temperature, humidity, and pH levels.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>To set up the system, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ESP32 microcontroller</li>
<li>Sensors for temperature, humidity, and pH levels</li>
<li>An MQTT broker</li>
<li>A Django server</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have all the necessary components, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the sensors to the ESP32 microcontroller according to their specifications.</li>
<li>Set up the ESP32 to connect to your Wi-Fi network.</li>
<li>Configure the ESP32 to send data via MQTT to your broker.</li>
<li>Set up a Django server and create a database to store the incoming data.</li>
<li>Create Django views to display the data in a user-friendly format.</li>
<li>Optionally, set up alerts to notify you when certain thresholds are exceeded.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once the system is set up, it will begin collecting data from the sensors and sending it to the Django server via MQTT. You can view the data in real-time by accessing the Django views, which will display the latest readings for each sensor.</p>
<p>You can also use the data to make informed decisions about managing your hydroponic setup. For example, if the temperature is too high, you may need to adjust your ventilation system to keep the plants from overheating. If the pH levels are too low, you may need to add more nutrients to the solution.</p>
